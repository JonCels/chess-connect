\section{Scope}
The Chess Connect system includes a physical chess board and associated software 
application to aid in the learning and sharing of in-person chess games. 
Mechanical design of the chess board and electrical systems are included in the 
scope. Design of the user interface and communication between the systems is also
included. 
Not included is the design of the chess AI being used as a learning tool. Exisiting
chess websites and platforms are also out of the scope of Chess Connect.

\section{Project Overview}

\subsection{Normal Behaviour}{
The normal operation of the chess board involves configuring game mode and settings, reading the physical 
positions and identifiers (magnetic strength) of the pieces, lighting up corresponding LEDs and determining 
legal moves on the micro-controller. There will be three game modes: Normal Mode (no LED feedback), Engine 
Mode (best moves calculated by a chess engine and displayed by an LCD display) and Beginner Mode (legal moves
 displayed by LED when a piece is picked up). The micro-controller will also be simultaneously transmitting 
 data to the server via Bluetooth and receiving responses in the form of ``best'' moves from the server. The 
 server will be calculating these best moves in real time depending on the configuration of the pieces on the 
 board sent from the chess board, and sending it back over Bluetooth every time it is queriedwhile the game is
  in ``Engine Mode''. The server will also be communicating all of this information to a web application where 
  users can tune in and watch the pieces and seegame stats in real time.
}

\subsection{Undesired Event Handling}
When an unexpected event occurs, chess connect will always return to the most 
appropriate safe state. When an action during a game, the on-board LCD screen 
displays the error and provides instructions to correct the mistake and proceed 
normally. When an error occurs in the communication between sub-systems, all 
activememory is stored and a default error screen appears on the LCD screen to 
inform the players.

\subsection{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

Requirements GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GI1, GI2, GI3, NB2, NB3, EB2, EB3, EB4, BB3, BB4, BB5 describe a variety of 
buttons to support game flow and modes. Too many physical buttons were required so an LCD screen was placed on 
the side of the board to accomodate the large number of functions. 
\\ \\
Requirements GI5, GI6, ND1, NA1, ED1, ED2, EA1, BD1 dictated decisions for specific information to be 
communicated from the board to the Web Application. Serial Communication was chosen to display a custom 
string to communicate the necessary game state, errors and best moves between the board and the application. 
\\ \\
Requirements NB1, EB1, BB1 describe the memory performance required of the hardware to store game data of 
entire games. Design satisfies this requirement with the addition of two processors to share the memory load
and processing load.
\\ \\
Requirement BB2 outlined the implementation of LEDs requiring fast response times. Due to communication 
protocols, screens and sensors are already consuming processor time, a second processor was added with faster 
processing speed to handle the LEDs and sensors exclusively.
%wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
%  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
 % design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  %they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  %requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  %requirements with a password.}

\section{User Interfaces}

\subsection{Hardware Interface}
The user will interact with two main components of the hardware.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Magnetic chess pieces
  \item Physical chess board containing sensors
\end{itemize}
They will interact with the chess pieces and chess board as they would in a normal chess game. The chess board reflects a standard chess board, with 
LEDs in the center of each square. They would move the chess pieces on the board and remove them in according to the rules of chess. If the device
is set to beginner mode, the LEDs will light up in according to which available moves are available for that chess piece. They would interact with the LEDs
by using them as a guide for potential moves to make.

\subsection{Software Interface}
The users will interact with the software component of this device through a web application. They would need a device with an internet connection and and internet browser
to view the application. The user will interact with this interface by visual viewing the chess board status in real time including a visualization of the chess piece locations.
They will also be able to turn on and off beginner mode in this interface through clicking an interactive button in the web application. 

\section{Design of Hardware}
To build the custom chess board for Chess Connect we designed a modified chess 
board to fulfill the requirements of the system. The chess board has visible 
LEDs from below the board that can be seen in the figure below. 
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{chess_board.jpg}
    \caption{Hardware Design}
    \label{Fig_Hardware_Design} 
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
The chess board will be hollow and contain enough space to contain the 
electronics. An AC power cable will protrude from the side of the board to 
connect to an outlet nearby.

\subsection{Wiring Diagram}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{wiring_diagram.pdf}
    \caption{Electrical Wiring Diagram}
    \label{Fig_Wiring_Dgm} 
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{LED and Piece Interaction}
Each square on the chessboard will contain a Hall sensor and a green LED. The LEDs are to indicate where a piece can possibly go, depending on which mode the user is in. For example, 
if the user is in a beginner’s mode and picks up the White King, then the LEDs surrounding all the squares where the King is picked up from will light up telling the user that the 
King can be placed on any of those squares. The logic for which LEDs light up depend on a few things:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The type of piece. Different LEDs would light up for King, Queen etc.
  \item If any of the user’s own color piece is placed on a square, that LED would not light up as you cannot place two pieces on the same square. However, if an opponent’s piece is 
  placed on a square, that LED may light up provided it is a valid move depending on the type of piece the user is making the move with.
  \item Any square further away from a square where user’s own piece is present, will not light up as the pieces cannot jump a piece unless it is a Knight.
\end{itemize}
  Let us see the working of the LEDs considering the example on a 5x5 grid as shown in the figure below. ‘1-5’ are the rows and ‘A-E’ are the columns. ‘a-e’ are the twenty-five different LEDs corresponding to 
  each square. The green background squares will indicate the LED to be ON for that square in the grid.

  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{line2}
    \caption{5x5 Grid}
  \end{figure}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Case 1: King present in the middle of a 5x5 grid chessboard. The King can move only one square in any direction – up, down, to the sides, and diagonally.

    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{king}
      \captionof{figure}{Potential moves for the King}
  \end{minipage}

  The LEDs g,h,i,l,n,q,r,s will light up for the potential moves provided those squares are empty or an opponent’s piece is placed on those squares.

    \item Case 2: Queen present in the middle of a 5x5 grid chessboard. The Queen can move multiple squares in any one direction - forward, backward, sideways and 
    diagonally as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces.

    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{queen}
      \captionof{figure}{Potential moves for the Queen}
  \end{minipage}

  The LEDs a,c,e,g,h,i,k,l,n,o,q,r,s,u,w,y will light up for the potential moves provided those squares are empty or an opponent’s piece is placed on those squares.

    \item Case 3: Bishop present in the middle of a 5x5 grid chessboard. The Bishop can move multiple squares but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) 
    and must always stay on that color. 

    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{bishop}
      \captionof{figure}{Potential moves for the Bishop}
  \end{minipage}

  The LEDs a,e,g,i,q,s,u,y will light up for the potential moves provided those squares are empty or an opponent’s piece is placed on those squares.

    \item Case 4: Knight present in the middle of a 5x5 grid chessboard. The Knight can move two squares in one direction, and then one more move at a 90-degree angle in either 
    direction, just like the shape of an “L”. 

    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{knight}
      \captionof{figure}{Potential moves for the Knight}
  \end{minipage}

  The LEDs b,d,f,j,p,t,v,x will light up for the potential moves provided those squares are empty or an opponent’s piece is placed on those squares. Knight is the only chess 
  piece that can skip over a piece and be placed even if it is immediately surrounded by a user’s own piece. For example, if there is user’s own pieces present at the 
  squares B2, B3 and B4, the user can still place the Knight at A2, A4, B1 or B6 by skipping over the other pieces.

    \item Case 5: Rook present in the middle of a 5x5 grid chessboard. The Rook can move multiple squares but only forward, backward or to the sides. 
  
    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{rook}
      \captionof{figure}{Potential moves for the Rook}
  \end{minipage}

  The LEDs c,h,k,l,n,o,r,w will light up for the potential moves provided those squares are empty or an opponent’s piece is placed on those squares.

    \item Case 6: Pawn present in the middle of a 5x5 grid chessboard. Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward but capture 
    diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares.

    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pawn}
      \captionof{figure}{Potential moves for the Pawn}
  \end{minipage}

  The LEDs c,g,h,i will light up for the potential moves provided those squares are empty or an opponent’s piece is placed on those squares. For pawn, the LED ‘c’ only 
  lights up if it is the first time a pawn is making a move. After a pawn has been moved once, it can never move two squares at once. Also, a pawn can move diagonally, 
  only if there is an opponent’s piece is present on those squares. Otherwise, it can only move in the forward direction. For example, the LED ‘g’ or ‘i’ will only light 
  up if there is an opponent’s piece present on them. 

  \end{itemize}
  


\subsection*{Truth Table for LEDs}

Based on the assumptions above, the Truth Table for the LEDs 'a-y' would as shown in the figure below. 
The digit '0' means LED is OFF and '1' means LED is ON.

\section{Design of Communication Protocols}

\subsection{Arduino Mega to Teensy}
The two processors communicate to share game state, game mode and move information for smooth 
performance. Arduino Mega collects data and forms the current game state from the sensors given. 
Once the current game state is formed it is sent via serial communication to the Teensy 
processor. The string is in the form of FEN@Game Mode@Resign. 
\subsection{Web Application to Teensy}
The processor and the web application communicate to share current game state, game mode and 
best moves from the engine. The Teensy sends a string in from of FEN@Game Mode to the web application
to perform best move calculations. Once the web application finds the best moves, it will send a
string in the form of bestMove1@bestMove2@bestMove3 back to the Teensy.

\section{Interface}
An online chess game typically has a user interface that includes a chess 
board display, where the player can see the current state of the game and make
 moves. Our web application will only serve as an additional display for the 
 moves being played on the physical board, simply mirroring the moves with 
 minimal latency over Bluetooth. The different modes on the physical board 
 will also be compatible with the moves displayed on the web application. A 
 web application interface aims to be more intuitive for players that are 
 accustomed to online chess and might also allow for a more immersive viewing
 experience for spectators.

%interaction with, the user interface}

\section{Reflection}

\subsection*{Project Limitations}
There are a few limitations in our design. The first one is that the device is not wireless. It requires a wired power supply at all times. This could be improved by adding a wireless
power supply to the device. Then it would only need to be charged every so often, rather than requiring a constant supply of power. Another limitation is that the device always needs to be connected to
the Internet to upload the real-time game data. With unlimited resources, we could put an LTE chip in our device to ensure there is always a connection to the Internet. Although this is
not feasible for the scope of the project. Lastly, a limitation is the physical size and portability of the device. The final product is expected to be larger than a chess board, as well as
approximately 15cm thick. With more money and time, the size could be reduced to improve the portability.

\subsection*{Other Considered Designs}
One problem that we had to overcome in our design is that there are not enough input and output pins in one microcontroller for all of the components.
One solution we considered was having multiple microcontrollers for this project to ensure there is one input pin for each input sensor and one output pin for each output.
This design would be beneficial in the way of simplicity of code. The tradeoff would be the complexity in coordinating the communication between multiple microcontrollers and the 
web application. A second option to solve this problem is to use multiplexing to reduce the number of input and output pins needed for a large number of components. 
This option requires more complex code, but only requires one microcontroller device. We chose to implement the multiplexing option because it only used one device which saves money,
as well as eliminates the need to coordinate between multiple microcontrollers.
