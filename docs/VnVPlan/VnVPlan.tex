%You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
%You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
%for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
SRS verification is performed by the teammates throughout the design and testing 
process. They will reference requirements and consider the results throughout design. 
Teammates will periodically verify this completeness throughout the design process. 
The verification and validation report will reference an associated requirement for 
each test. This allows for tracking of individual requirement fullfilment 
throughout the process. 
%List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
%be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
%something more rigorous/systematic in mind..

%Remember you have an SRS checklist

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
\textbf{Hardware Design Verification} begins with LTSpice and Multisim design software
packages. The designed circuits are simulated in the software and tested accordingly.
Testingincludes simulating inputs and verifying that expected outputs are returned. 
Edge cases are simulated to verify safety and failure conditions of the circuits. 
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Software Design Verification} utilizes the compiler to verify code correctness. 
Arduino intergrated development environments contain the tools to compile and check for 
errors. Code walkthroughs are performed by collaborators that did not write the program. 
This includes detailed inspection and a report describing the function of the code 
based on their perspective. This tests the readability and functionality of 
the code. 
%Plans for design verification}
%The review will include reviews by your classmates}
%Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

The Verification and Validation Plan verification will include reviewing the \href{file:../Checklists/VnV-Checklist.pdf}{Verification and Validation Plan checklist} and adjusting this document accordingly. The verification will also include considering feedback from issues created by another team, as well as from the TA assigned to this project. Comments and improvements will be implemented after completing revision 0 of this document.
%The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.

%The review will include reviews by your classmates

%Create a checklists?

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}
\textbf{Hardware Implementation Verification} begins with individual components. First 
the power supply is tested with a voltemeter for accuracy and precision. Then, 
the microcontroller is powered on and each individual I/O is tested for correctness. 
Inputs will be powered via the power supply and readings are verified for correctness 
using custom testing software installed on the controller. Outputs are verified using 
the voltemeter to measure correctness relative to the controller value. Finally, 
sensors and circuits are tested using the IO of the microcontroller. This allows
for accurate and detailed inspection of the components and verifies their correctness. 
\newline 
\newline 
\textbf{Software Implementation Verification} requires the hardware to be tested and 
assembled before beginning. The software is downloaded to the controller and the inputs 
and outputs are configured one-by-one. Functionality of code is tested with unit tests
from section 5.1 with the appropriate hardware. Once each section is unit tested, the
sub-systems can begin to combine to test completness of full systems and their functionality.

%You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
%testing plan.
%In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
%the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
%inspection, static analyzers, etc.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Automated testing will be carried out for the software involved with this project. Unit tests will be created to test the functionality fo each function created for the program. A minimum of one "successful" test will be written to describe the intended program execution, and one or more "unsuccessful" tests will be written to test the robustness of the program. This will ensure complete code coverage for the software. There are 3 main classes of tests that will be run involving the different aspects \progname{}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Linting:} Performed on Python and Javascript code. This will be integrated into VS Code to assist in local development; this will be run as a Github Workflow as a non-blocking check before building the software.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint}{ESLint} to be used for Javascript
      \item \href{https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8}{Flake8} to be used for Python
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Unit Tests:} Detailed in \hyperref[UnitTests]{Section \ref*{UnitTests}}, unit tests will be performed for Python, Javascript and C code.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \href{https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library}{React Testing Library} will be used for Javascript unit tests.
      \item \href{https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/}{PyTest} will be used for Python unit tests.
      \item \href{https://aceunit.sourceforge.net/}{AceUnit} will be used for C unit tests.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Dynamic Analysis Tool:} in addition to creating unit tests for the C code, memory leaks and access errors will be caught using \href{https://valgrind.org/}{ValGrind}.
  
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Debuggers:} Dynamic analysis will also be performed on the code through debuggers to verify the system and unit tests, as well as normal operation. These tools will be used extensively to bring all unit tests to a successful state, and to determine the root cause of any inconsistent behaviour from the hardware.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The broswer's (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) built in debugger will be used for stepping through the Javascript code on the web application.
    \item \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html}{pdb} will be used for Python debugging.
    \item \href{https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/zero/debugging-with-zero}{Arduino Zero Built-in Debugger Interface} will be used for debugging embedded C code.
  \end{itemize}


%What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics. Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for Python.

%If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to that document.

%The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the implementation.



\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

Software will be validated by reviewing the requirements in the \href{file:../SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirement Specifications} document and ensuring the software matches the expected performance and behaviour. The chess engine software integration will be validated by comparing it alongside an established online chess engine running the same Stockfish build as is selected for \progname{}, and comparing the recommended moves. One webside that may be used is \href{https://www.365chess.com/analysis_board.php}{365Chess.com}.
\newline
\newline
Feedback from members of the team that are assigned to another area of the system will be called to verify the software is performing adequately. For example, a member working on the web app may come to test the hardware to ensure the sequences and behaviour is intuitive and user friendly. Feedback and comments from the professor and TA assigned to this project will also be considered when making ajustments to the software.
\newline
\newline
Unit tests will be created that capture both normal-use and failure modes to validate the software as well. Unit tests will be integrated in a Github workflow to ensure that changes are never made to the software that conflict with other areas of the code. Failing unit tests will be used as direction to change parts of the software back to a valid state of operation.

%If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that here.

%You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based inspection?

%This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.

            each wire in the sample are measured and recorded. The power shall then be calculated and recorded. The maximum power of any wire
            in the sample must not exceed the safe limits determined in the Canadian Electrical Code \cite{CanadianElectricalCode2021}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Precision and Accuracy}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT9}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in the initial game state.
                            
        Input/Condition: Users are instructed to play a full game of chess using the \progname{} system.
                            
        Output/Result: The web application will properly reflect the moves made on the physical product the majority of the time.
                            
        How test will be performed: A test group of people who have played chess in the past or play chess regularly are asked to play a full game of chess. 
            Their moves and the web application response will be recorded and compared against each other. The number of discrepancies between the physical 
            moves and moves made on the web application will be recorded. The number of discrepancies averaged over the entire test group must be less than 
            or equal to 1.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Capacity}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT10}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in the initial game state and is in engine mode.
                            
        Input/Condition: Moves are made until the game state is in one of a set of predetermined computationally complicated chess positions.
                            
        Output/Result: The level of memory used by the web application shall be no more than 1 Gigabyte (GB) at any measured point.
                            
        How test will be performed: Moves will be made until the game state is in one of a set of predetermined computationally complicated chess positions. 
            The engine will then be using the maximum amount of memory to compute the best possible moves for the position. The amount of memory used will be 
            measured and recorded using windows task manager. The amount of memory must never exceed 1 GB at any measured point.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Security}
\paragraph{Integrity}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT11}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in normal mode and a chess game is in progress on the system.
                            
        Input/Condition: The Bluetooth connection is severed between the web application and the product.
                            
        Output/Result: The web application indicates that the Bluetooth connection has been lost.
                            
        How test will be performed: A game of chess is being played when the Bluetooth option is switched off on the server, severing the connection.
            The web application must display an alert that the Bluetooth connection has been lost.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{NFT12}

        Type: Structural, Static, Manual
                            
        Initial State: The product is in normal mode and a chess game is in progress on the system.
                            
        Input/Condition: The power connection to the system is severed.
                            
        Output/Result: The system stores the game state in local memory until power is restored.
                            
        How test will be performed: A game of chess is being played when the power is switched off. The power is then restored after 5 or more seconds. A single
            move is made and the state of the game is tested against the web application. The state of the game should be unchanged from before power was lost.

%   selection.}  
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has

% \subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

% \subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

% \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}

% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%   tests were selected.}

% \wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
%   performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Arduino Zero Built-in Debugger Interface} is 
  necessary to simulate and test the arduino code on the microcontroller. 
  Learning the software requires reading documentation for installing 
  and operating the debugger. As well, interpreting the outputs from 
  the debugger requires practice. Joshua Chapman will be taking this
  responsibility.
  \item \textbf{React Testing Library} is used for testing web 
  application code. All coding in the web application will be done 
  using javascript and react. Documentation for using the library will be read
  and experimented to develop a thorough understanding.
   Rupinder Nagra and Jonathan Cels will be taking this responsibility. 
  \item \textbf{Pytest} is used to perform unit tests on python code
  for custom microcontroller programming and bluetooth connection. Documentation to 
  use the desired functionality will be read. Additionally, a learning period will 
  be required to properly learn the outputs of the unit tester. 
  Jonathan Cels and Arsheep Aujla will be taking this responsibility.
  \item \textbf{Flake8} simplifies the Github workflow by performing non-blocking 
  checks on integrated code. Integrating it into Github will require reading 
  documentation and practicing before important deadlines. Alexander Van Kralingen 
  will be taking this responsibility.
\end{enumerate}
