\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Document Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide a set of requirements for a system that will integrate over-the-board chess with the online world of chess to assist in learning the game in a flexible manner.
This includes a detailed description of our functional and non-functional requirements, including the performance and attributes of our design. 
The document also includes a project overview showcasing the behaviour with event handling and system diagrams, and the likely and unlikely changes we expect to 
encounter throughout the development of our product.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader}
{The document is written with the purpose of guiding development for the \progname{} team. The intended readers of this document 
are the developers of \progname{}, Dr.~Spencer Smith, and Nicholas Annable, the teaching assistant assigned to this project. The 
document is thus written for an audience that is well-versed in formal specification at a university level. This includes models, 
diagrams, and mathematical notation. Readers should also have a university-level understanding of electrical circuit knowledge.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended User}
{This project will assist chess players of any level that are looking for a tool to help them learn and study the game. For beginners, 
the board serves as a learning tutorial and a general introduction to the game, while intermediate and advanced players can use the 
engine move recommendations to study new lines, puzzles, and specific positions to enhance their chess skills.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
{The professor and TAs for the course SFWRENG 4G06 as they will be providing the feedback which will directly affect the project’s development. 
Society is also a stakeholder because this project will provide the members of society another gateway to be involved in the community through the game of chess. Lastly, this project will 
also be relevant to chess tournament organizers looking for a method to easily broadcast and share their games online in real-time.}

\section{Problem Description}

{Online chess has functionality for both beginners and experienced players to
learn and practice the game. However, these forms of learning emphasize a
visual style of learning using a standard keyboard and mouse, while physical
boards place emphasis on tactile learning when learning or studying the game.
The highest-rated chess players often use a combination of the two styles to
optimize their play. However, no option exists for players of any skill level to
integrate their over-the-board and online play with one solution.\\
Chess Connect plans to centralize these two mediums of studying the game in
order to provide flexibility and remove constraints for new players in learning
how to play chess.}

\section{Scope}
{The system is called \progname{}, and will include a software application and physical hardware device. The hardware will take the 
form of a chess set, and will collect and relay move and piece data. The device will convey the best moves for the specific board 
position, and will convey legal moves for specific pieces.The device will be connected to the software application, relaying and 
receiving relevant data. The software application will model and track the physical device, and will broadcast the data in an accessible 
format. The application will be constrained to a 2-dimensional model of the hardware device, showing a top-down view of the game.}

\bigskip
\noindent{\textbf{In-scope} items for the system include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Modeling and tracking a chess game played using the \progname{} hardware
    \item Displaying and broadcasting the game state on the \progname{} software application
    \item Giving users an option to choose between beginner mode, engine mode, and normal mode
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beginner mode will display legal moves for individual pieces when a chess piece is picked up, and will warn the players when an illegal move is made
        \item Engine mode will display the best moves as determined by a chess engine for the position
        \item Normal mode will disable the engine and beginner mode features. This is intended for regular play between experienced players
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}}

\bigskip

\noindent{The following items are deemed to be \textbf{out of scope}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item FIDE (International Chess Federation) standards for tournament appropriate chess equipment
    \item Tracking and support for alternate chess variants such as Chess960, Atomic Chess, King of the Hill. More information found here: \cite{ListOfChessVariants2022}.
    \item Proper tracking of alternate starting positions like puzzles
    \item Proper tracking of illegal moves and rule violations when warnings are ignored
\end{enumerate}}

\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{System Context Diagram}{

    The context of the system invloves two integrated but separate system components, as well as two distinct end users.

    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{chess-connect-system-context.png}
        \caption{System Context}
        \label{Fig_SystemContext} 
    \end{figure}
}

\subsection{Behaviour Overview}{


\subsection{Normal Operation}
\subsubsection{Description}{
    The normal operation of the chess board involves configuring game mode and settings, reading the physical positions and identifiers (magnetic strength) of the pieces, 
    lighting up corresponding LEDs and determining legal moves on the microcontroller. There will be three game modes: Normal Mode (no LED feedback), Engine Mode (best moves 
    calculated by a chess engine and displayed by an LCD display) and Beginner Mode (legal moves displayed by LED when a piece is picked up). The microcontroller will also be 
    simultaneously transmitting data to the server via Bluetooth and receiving responses in the form of ``best'' moves from the server. The server will be calculating these 
    best moves in real time depending on the configuration of the pieces on the board sent from the chess board, and sending it back over Bluetooth every time it is queried
    while the game is in ``Engine Mode''. The server will also be communicating all of this information to a web application where users can tune in and watch the pieces and see
    game stats in real time.
}

\subsubsection{Use Cases/Scenarios}{
    
    \paragraph{Normal Mode}{
        Users play the game without any LED feedback. This would typically be a formal match involving players that are familiar with the game. Moves would still be broadcast to the
        web application, and move history will still be recorded for future reference.
    }
        
    \paragraph{Engine Mode}{
        Users play the game with LCD feedback indicating which pieces to move to which positions that would be statistically the most probable move to win the game. This game mode would
        be most likely played as a way to improve one's skill level and to gain a deeper understanding of the game.
    }
    
    \paragraph{Beginner Mode}{
        Users play the game with LED feedback on lifting a piece. The piece lifted will be determiend by the hardware and corresponding legal moves will be lit up on the board. This game
        mode is designed to help beginners learn the game of chess. Legal moves will involve more complex strategies such as ``en passant'' and ``castling''.
    }
        
    \paragraph{Studying Past Games}{
        The web application will have a record of the moves made in past games. This can be used to study the game moves and understand scenarios which could have been handled differently
        to produce a more favourable outcome.
    }
    
    \paragraph{Tournament Play}{
        Since the moves made in the game will be broadcasted live to the internet via the web application, tournaments can be held with spectators watching the game in real time.
    }
}

\subsection{Undesired Scenario Handling}{
    \paragraph{Earthquake Scenario}{
        Also known as the ``sore loser scenario'', when some or all of the pieces are removed from their spaces within a short amount of time, the game will be ended as a draw. 
    }
    
    \paragraph{Power Loss}{
        When the power to the board is cut, the web application will end the game as a draw. The board will also have to be reconfigured back into the default starting positions for all pieces.
    }
    
    \paragraph{Bluetooth Disconnection}{
        On bluetooth disconnection, the board will attempt to reconnect for 30 seconds. Upon the expiration of this timer, the game will end as a draw.
    }
    
    \paragraph{Internet Disconnection}{
        On internet disconnection, the server will keep a history of past moves made. On reconnection, the game will be updated to reflect these moves as they are sent through the
        queue to the hosted interface.
    }
    
    \paragraph{Cheating}{
        If pieces are moved or removed out of turn, the spaces which were affected will be lit up with red LEDs. When the board is returned to the state before cheating occured,
        the game will resume as normal.
    }

\section{Likely Changes}
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}[{LC}1., leftmargin=2\parindent]
    \item Reviewing past games allows players to evaluate their own positions with a better understanding on how to play in future games.
    We will use databases such as MySQL and MongoDB in order to store these games for users to view.
    \item An additional user mode, Study Mode, that will allow users to set up puzzles that do not start from the default position.
    It will allow users to practice a specific phase of the game, including the ability to take back moves without having to play out a full game with an opponent. 
    This mode is meant to be used individually, also allowing a user to use and study the board without the necessity of another player.
    \item Online chess has extensive communities on existing platforms. To promote code reusability, the Chess Connect online platform will interface with popular existing websites.
    Users of the board have the capability to share their games with a larger community via these platforms in addition to the custom web application. These sites include, but are not limited to, Chess.com and Lichess.
    \item An additional game setting to enable either white or black to be a ``computer'' opponent will be implemented in Engine Mode. The user will be able to set a skill level
    for the computer, and moves will be displayed as squares lit up by the on-board LEDs.
    \item The backend/database programming languages and frameworks previously listed
    are subject to change depending on the use of the data transfer functionality, in which comptibility to the hardware would play a role
    in picking our technology stack.  
    \item The load capacity of our system is initially set low for the
    first edition of this application. As demand for the application increases, the load capacity must also increase to support a
    larger user base.
    \item The method of data transfer is subject to change depending on
    interfacing between the hardware and software. Examples of these are Bluetooth and USB connected to the board.
    \item The dimensions of the chess board are subject to change based
    the 3D-printed designs we use for the pieces. 
    \item When pieces are lost, power is cut or data transmission is cut, the current result is ending the game as a draw. Adding the ability for the board to start from any state
    would allow the players to resume from where they left off. This would require several other options such as ``which colour starts'', ``pausing the game'' and ``resume from
    last saved configuration''.
\end{enumerate}
  
\section{Unlikely Changes}    
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}[{UC}1., leftmargin=2\parindent]
    \item Since overarching idea of the project is integration between
    over the board and online chess, a web application will be necessary.
    \item There must be sensors to locate the pieces in order to solve tracking and object detection.
    \item The most popular and easy to use chess engine is Stockfish, which is 
    open source and includes a well-written API documentation. This will likely be the engine we will be using for predicting future moves.
    \item As a learning application, giving beginners the ability to learn quickly
    is a big priority, so the application will include a beginner mode to help familiarize players with the movement of the chess pieces.
    \item Although the back-end/database technologies are subject to change,
    the front-end will make use of our past members' experience in user interface design. For this reason, the technologies
    previously mentioned for front-end are unlikely to change.
