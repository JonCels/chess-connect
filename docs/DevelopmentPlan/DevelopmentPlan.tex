\section{Team Meeting Plan}
{The team will meet weekly on Thursdays at 10:20 AM until 11:20 AM. 
Team members are expected to attend the Thursday lecture and meet up following the lecture. 
On the event that no lecture is scheduled, the meeting time shall be changed to 9:30 AM until 11:20 AM.}

\medskip
\noindent{Additional meetings will be scheduled when necessary using the communication methods outlined in the Team Communication Plan.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}
{The team will communicate over a Discord group channel. Each team member is expected to have Discord downloaded and readily accessible on at least one of their devices. 
In the case of emergencies or time-critical situations, a team member will use SMS text messaging in place of Discord. Text messages will only be used in critical situations.}

\medskip
\noindent{Issues will be managed using a Kanban board, implemented with a Git project board. Tasks will be split into small, workable items with differing deadlines and importance.}

\section{Workflow Plan}
{The project will use the feature-branch methodology in Git. An outline of the workflow is as follows:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pull any changes from the master branch
    \item Create a new branch for development of a specific feature or subsystem
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Use branch names that are descriptive to the feature
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Commit code frequently with descriptive messages
    \item Add unit and integration tests for the changes
    \item Push code to branch
    \item Create a pull request
    \item Another team member reviews and approves or rejects the pull request
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The tests are reviewed and more tests are created if necessary
            \item The pull request cannot be approved if all tests do not pass
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Merge feature branch into the main branch
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

The proof of concept demonstration will involve both a hardware component and a software component.
\paragraph{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Components Involved: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Three different chess pieces with embedded magnets (ex: white queen, white pawn, black knight).
        \item Two 3D-printed squares with Hall-effect sensors and LEDs attached.
        \item LCD screen is configured and wired to display piece recognition. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Demonstration:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Separate pieces are placed on the two squares.  
        \item One of the pieces will capture the other as per the rules of chess.
        \item The LCD screen will display the states of each square including the colour and type of piece. 
    \end{enumerate} 
    \item Risks:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The configuration of the sensors might be challenging to coordinate (sixty-four different sensors means many IOs to process at once). Correctly configuring two pieces means this can be easily scaled to sixty-four.
        \item The sensor accuracy is something that could create a barrier to identifying six different pieces in each colour. Inaccuracy could mean misreading the identity of the piece on the square. Correctly sensing three different pieces will prove that this barrier can be overcome.
        \item Supply-chain issues could mean some of the products selected for this project may not arrive on time for the demonstration.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concepts to Demonstrate:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Front-end User Interface (UI)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Demo Platform:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.figma.com/}{Figma Design Platform}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Demonstration
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The UI layout will be shown, as well as all of the various components that will (eventually) connect to the back-end and hardware. The Bluetooth connection will provide the information needed to populate the UI with pieces, valid moves, best moves, game modes, etc. The Bluetooth connection will not be a part of this proof of concept because it is a tool that has been tested and proven in many other applications. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Risks:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Hardware-software connection could be problematic due to signal loss or dropped communication packets. This will not be demonstrated in the proof of concept plan. However, Bluetooth is a commonly used communication method and should be a reliable information stream for the web application.
        \item Communication speed could limit the processing of valid moves and add delays to the connection between the moving pieces and the display on the UI. The speed in which pieces are identified and processed can show that this information can be sent over Bluetooth and processed for the web app quickly and efficiently.
        \item Chess engines could be resource intensive and the web application hosting platform and user system could prevent the user experience from being smooth and responsive. Displaying a light interface without too many calculations involved will minimize the computing power needed to provide a smooth user experience.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Coding Standard}
{The project will follow the \href{https://github.com/airbnb/javascript}{Airbnb style guide} for JavaScript development, and use the \href{https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/}{Flake8 style guide} for Python development.}

\section{Project Scheduling}
{The project will use a GitHub project board to track and schedule tasks on a weekly basis.} 

\medskip
\noindent{Technical roles are decided on the basis of prior knowledge and interest. In the case of the team leader, the role will change with every deliverable. Team members are responsible for decomposing their tasks into kanban items, individually or alongside other team members working on the same task.}

\medskip
\noindent{Major milestones will be tracked on the project board. Milestones include both hard and soft deadlines for task completion. Hard deadlines are the project deliverable due dates. Soft deadlines are decided by the team for the completion of technical tasks.}
