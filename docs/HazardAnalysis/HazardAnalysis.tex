\section{Introduction}{
    Creating a product designed for consumer use requires a robust hazard identification and mitigation strategy before the 
    product is released to the public. A hazard can be defined as any source of potential damage, harm or adverse health effects 
    on something or someone \cite{CCOHS}. A hazard for the \progname{} system is anyhting that could either harm the user or cause system failure.
}

\section{Project Overview}
\projectoverview

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}{
    In this document, the potential cause for hazards will be explored in detail, as well as methods for preemptive detection, 
    and recommended actions should the hazard still present itself. Its purpose is to identify potential sources for harm or 
    failure and address them before they are presented in the finished product.
}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}{
    The \progname{} system is comprised of three main components:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The hardware including the chess pieces, board, microcontroller and all electronic components:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item LEDs
            \item Hall-Effect sensors
            \item LCD screen
            \item Connecting wires
            \item Power adapter
        \end{itemize}
        \item The nearby server to recieve data through a Bluetooth connection.
        \item The hosted Web Application used to connect to the game remotely.
    \end{enumerate}

    The system boundary encompasses the chess board and extends to the Web Application (Web-App). 
    To bridge the distance between the chess board and the server, a Bluetooth connection is established, 
    and a Wi-Fi connection links the server to the Web-App. \\

    Interacting with the hardware and Web-App will be the means by which the user accesses the system, 
    while the system components in-between will remain isolated within the boundary. 
    Additionally, the power adapter required to power the Arduino controller will cross the boundary, 
    either from a wall or laptop source. A low-voltage adapter will be selected for this purpose, as it 
    supplies the necessary 5V to power the Arduino and its components.\\

    \hyperref[Fig_SystemContext]{Figure \ref{Fig_SystemContext}} details the interactions between each of the three major components. 
    A more detailed overview of the hardware components can be found in the \href{file:../Design/SystDesign/SystDes.pdf}{System Design} document.

          \label{Fig_SystemContext} 
        \end{center}
      \end{figure}
}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

The assumptions made in this document are meant to constrain the hazards to those present within typical operation. These assumptions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The chess board is operated in a dry environment.
    \item The server present will be capable of both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections.
    \item The user is not intentionally trying to disconnect the electronics within the board.
    \item The Web-App hosting platform will remain up and running without interruption.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}
{The failure modes and effects analysis is used to identify and analyze potential 
hazards to the system. Causes of failure discuss existing hazards that will have
negative effects on the system. Hazard detection details the methods used to distinguish
failures.Recommende actions explains the behavior of the system when the failures
occur. Likelihood is a scale to detail the frequency and probability-of-occurence
in the event of a failure. All of these methods are used to enhance requirement 
implementation and hazard prevention. \\

All prompts for user action will be displayed on the LCD embedded into the chess board.
Different prompts will correspond to different error screens, and different responses to the system.}

\section{Roadmap}

The hazard analysis has resulted in the development of more requirements related to the safety and security of the application. The hazard 
analysis also contains requirements that will be further specified in the VnV plan, allowing them to be verified according to specific 
fit criteria. This document will be frequently reviewed to recognize possible risks that can arise and reduce the likelihood of such
risks. Most of the requirements listed above will be applied to our project, while maintaining the possibility of not being able to 
implement some due to external factors such as project time constraints. Below is the planned roadmap of requirement implementation.

\textbf{Throughout the Course Term}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ACR1
    \item IR1
    \item IR2
