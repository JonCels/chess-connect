The Chess Connect project allows two users to play a game of chess on a physical board with the information being 
transmitted to an online web application over Bluetooth. Currently, there is no way for players to seamlessly switch 
between playing on a physical board and playing online, but Chess Connect intends to change this by creating a central 
platform that will provide flexibility and remove barriers for new players looking to learn the game.
